# Normal Vibration Distribution Search-Based Differential Evolution Algorithm for Multimodal Biomedical Image Registration
This code pertains to the study titled "Normal Vibration Distribution Search-Based Differential Evolution Algorithm for Multimodal Biomedical Image Registration," which is intended for submission to Neural Computing and Applications (NCAA) for revision. The source code for the Normal Vibration Distribution Search-Based Differential Evolution Algorithm (NVSA) has been written using the MATLAB programming language and is based on the Bernstein search-based differential evolution (BSD) algorithm. The code for multimodal Biomedical Image Registration will be updata soon.

# How to work
To utilize the NVSA algorithm, users can execute the "Runme.m" file, which enables them to explore the algorithm. Its effectiveness has been validated using a diverse range of classical functions with different search space dimensionalities. The code structure has been modeled after an example provided in the MATLAB File Exchange (https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/?q=profileid:251767).


# Bernstein search-based alrorithms 
In addition to the NVSA algorithm, other relevant Bernstein search-based algorithms such as the Bezier Search Differential Evolution Algorithm (BDE) and Bernstein-Levy Differential Evolution Algorithm (BDE) have been included for comparison purposes to enable a better evaluation of NVSA's performance.
